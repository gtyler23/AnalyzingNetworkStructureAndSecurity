<h1>Analyzing Network Structure and Security</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I used additional knowledge gained through training about networks to efficiently analyze a network incident scenario involving working for a company that offers web design services, graphic design, and social media marketing solutions to small businesses. The organization recently experienced a DDoS attack, which compromised the internal network for two hours until it was resolved. My job was to analyze the situation using the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) and create a quality cybersecurity incident report to build trust and improve security practices within my organization.
